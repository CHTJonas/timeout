# Terms and Conditions

Welcome to Timeout, the SRCF's solution to a free, easy and convenient video conferencing system. We're glad you're ready to get started but before that we need you to read and understand a few things about how our systems work.

## Data protection

We are compliant with the Data Protection Act, notably in regards to:

* The storage of cookies - we only store what is essential for the operation of Greenlight (the front-end) and BigBlueButton
* Recording - rooms are only recorded if the host allows them to be
  * We have made the recording of rooms toggleable per room
  * Due to the way that BigBlueButton manages recordings, the only way to be absolutely sure your data will not be stored on our system is to disable recordings. If you enable recordings for a room but don't press record, your unprocessed data files will still be stored for a maximum period of 7 days after which they shall be purged from our system. **This makes it possible for you to ask us for a room recording even if you forgot to press record!**

For a more detailed explanation of our terms and conditions, please visit [our documentation on this](https://docs.srcf.net/timeout/tos.html).
